    roadmap
    <p>
      Hong Kong’s road to pandemic recovery needs to be envisioned with a
      long-term goal of building a resilient society with the capacity to bridge
      existing and emerging gaps so as to absorb future shocks. 配图：流程图 Our
      ultimate goal is to facilitate Hong Kong’s recovery from the COVID-19
      pandemic, help it withstand future adverse shocks, and sustain economic
      growth and social equality. Goals: ●Develop and theorize a BRIDGE
      framework, which includes 1) Dilemma-Preference Gaps; 2) a Three-Route
      Resilience Building Model: Information & Technology, Trust, and
      Communication; and 3) a Gap Management Model: Identification, Mechanism
      Analysis, and Solution (Figure 1) to build resilience in a post-COVID
      society. ●Identify and monitor dilemma-preference gaps between the public
      and policymakers (namely, the different trade-offs each group prefers when
      confronted with risk avoidance vs. tolerance, collective good vs.
      individual rights, and public health vs. economy stability to aid
      policymaking and compliance). ●Formulate three resilience-building
      pathways by evaluating how information technology empowerment,
      institutional trust, and communication strategies work interdependently
      and in combination to build Hong Kong’s resilience. ●Construct an
      Individual Resilience Index to observe the change in Hong Kong’s
      resilience capacity. We define resilience capacity as an individual’s
      ability to endure the impacts of external shocks. ●Build practical
      guidelines, policy recommendations, and reference tools to aid efficient
      and effective policymaking processes in risk and crisis management.
      ●Create a free and open platform to synergize all efforts and synthesize
      the theoretical reflections, empirical findings, practical guidelines, and
      media coverage so various stakeholders can access the information they
      need.
